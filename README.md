# handgun

> This project is 'review tool' on web browser.

> This project must be used with ['handgun_api'](https://github.com/LTKSK/handgun_api).


## Build Setup
At First, you should activate 'handgun_api' on same host.
because 'handgun' access to 'handgun_api' on localhost.


This setting will be changed by config file. But not yet.


``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
